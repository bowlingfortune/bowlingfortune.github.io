# Bowling Fortune Teller - Feature Ideas

Ideas for future enhancements to the Bowling Fortune Teller application.

## 1. Frame Impact Analysis ‚≠ê
Show which frames helped or hurt your score the most:
- Highlight "hero frames" (best contributors) and "villain frames" (worst performers)
- Show delta from expected value for each frame position
- Visual indicators like üî• for exceptional frames, ‚ö†Ô∏è for costly misses
- "Your strike in frame 9 was worth +18 points compared to average"
- Render actual bowling scorecard visualization

## 2. Statistics Dashboard
Aggregate stats across all your saved games:
- Average score, high/low, standard deviation
- Total games bowled, total pins
- Strike percentage, spare conversion rate
- Trends over time (improving/declining)
- Visual charts showing progress

## 3. Comparison View
Compare two saved games side-by-side:
- Frame-by-frame comparison
- Highlight where one outperformed the other
- Show cumulative score difference as it develops
- "Game A was ahead until frame 7, then Game B pulled ahead"

## 4. Personal Records Tracking
Track and celebrate personal bests:
- Highest score, most strikes in a game, best 3-game series
- Show "üèÜ New Record!" when you beat your previous best
- Keep historical records

## 5. Pattern Recognition
Identify strengths and weaknesses by frame position:
- "You average 8.2 pins in frame 1 but only 6.5 in frame 7"
- "Your spare conversion rate drops in frames 8-10"
- Heat map visualization of strong/weak frames

## 6. What-If Scenarios
Simulate alternative outcomes:
- "What if you'd made that 7/ spare in frame 5?"
- Interactive frame editor to explore scenarios
- Show potential score range if you'd performed differently

## 7. Tags/Categories
Organize games with tags:
- "League", "Practice", "Tournament", "Fun", etc.
- Filter saved games by category
- Compare stats within categories ("I average 10 pins higher in league games")

## 8. Rolling Averages & Trends
Show improvement over time:
- 5-game, 10-game, 30-game rolling averages
- Visual graph of score progression
- "You're up 12 pins from your average last month"
